# LogView

## What is LogView?

### LogView is a React application that visualizes system-generated logs in a user-friendly table format.

## Key Features

- Data Fetching: It fetches log data from a file called "daily_log.log".
- Data Parsing: It parses the log entries, extracting relevant information such as date, time, device, user, source IP/port, NAT IP/port, and destination IP/port.
- Table Creation: It generates an interactive table to display the parsed log data.
- Data Display: The table presents columns for each data field, making it easy to read and analyze the log entries.
- Refresh Button: It offers a "Refresh" button to manually fetch and display the latest log data.

## Upcoming Features

- Filtering logs based on specific criteria
- Sorting logs by different fields
- Highlighting important events or patterns
- Exporting logs to other formats
